h1. DatabaseRecorder

This code is an experiment in recording and replaying a database connection in order to speed up tests.

See these posts for the initial idea and results:

* "Why exactly don't we stub that database?":http://svenfuchs.com/2010/11/24/why-exactly-don-t-we-stub-that-database
* "DatabaseRecorder - recording and replaying the database connection":http://svenfuchs.com/2011/2/9/databaserecorder-recording-and-replaying-the-database-connection

TLDR: It's currently not worth it because there's no performance gain.

If you're interested in picking this up or have any questions just drop me a note! :)
